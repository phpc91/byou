        <p>B.You is a monosyllabic word. It brings irreverence. It has rhythm. And a pause. It appeals to ones' authenticity.
            It has attitude. Essentially it is about you and how you view things. It connotes a sense of self fulfillment
            rather than something that is imposed. This is how we want you to view yourself. This is how we want you to view
            the world.   </p>
