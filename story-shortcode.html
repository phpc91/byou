        B.You is a people-first brand, envisioned by former Master Degree colleagues and savy food entrepreneurs. 25+ years of long
        lasting friendships, real brotherhood and an ambitious calling to promote great-tasting and healthy food products
        in an authentic and respectful way are at the core of our beliefs and execution. We strive to fulfill customers needs
        regarding food comsumption and delight in such a demanding and time-constraint world, but without compromising quality,
        trust or compassion. After all, we are all here to enjoy these treats together, not at the cost of others.
        <p style="font-family: geomanist-bold;"><br>In sum, we are proud of promoting goodness through food and want to inspire others to do the same. Because
            at the end it's not about me, it's about us.</p>

        <p>B.You is a monosyllabic word. It brings irreverence. It has rhythm. And a pause. It appeals to ones' authenticity.
            It has attitude. Essentially it is about you and how you view things. It connotes a sense of self fulfillment
            rather than something that is imposed. This is how we want you to view yourself. This is how we want you to view
            the world.   </p>
